  Dominant Control for iRacing
  Accessibility & Educational Tool
  Version 1.0.0 - Initial Release
================================================================================

IMPORTANT: READ THIS BEFORE RUNNING THE APPLICATION

================================================================================
  ⚠️ CRITICAL: FORCE FEEDBACK PRESERVATION
================================================================================

TO AVOID LOSING FORCE FEEDBACK:

  1. Start this application FIRST
  2. THEN start iRacing
  3. After sim loads, scan controls

OR: Enable "Keyboard Only Mode" in settings (eliminates issue completely)

WHY? Technical limitation of Python's joystick library. Starting app first
prevents device conflicts. Keyboard mode bypasses joystick handling entirely.

See INSTALLATION.md for detailed explanation.
