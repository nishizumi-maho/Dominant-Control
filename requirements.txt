## Platform Compatibility

### Supported
- ✅ Windows 10 (64-bit) - Build 1809 or later
- ✅ Windows 11 (all versions)

### Not Supported
- ❌ Windows 7/8/8.1 (end of life)
- ❌ Windows 10 (32-bit)
- ❌ macOS
- ❌ Linux

## Runtime Dependencies

### Required Windows Components
Most systems have these installed, but if needed:

**Visual C++ Redistributable** (usually pre-installed)
- Download from Microsoft if needed
- Free download from microsoft.com
- Required for some system operations

### iRacing Requirements
- iRacing must be installed
- Valid iRacing subscription
- Must be in an active session for telemetry

## File Size Information

- **Executable**: ~50-80 MB (compressed)
- **Extracted**: ~100-150 MB
- **Configuration files**: <1 MB
- **Total disk usage**: ~150-200 MB

## Performance Characteristics

### Resource Usage
- **CPU**: <5% during normal operation
- **RAM**: 50-100 MB typical
- **Disk I/O**: Minimal (config saves only)
- **GPU**: None (UI only, no 3D rendering)

### Update Frequency
- **Telemetry**: ~60 Hz (configurable)
- **HUD Update**: ~10 Hz
- **Input polling**: ~100 Hz

## Security Considerations

### What This Application Does
- ✅ Reads iRacing telemetry via standard SDK
- ✅ Monitors keyboard/controller inputs
- ✅ Displays HUD overlay
- ✅ Saves/loads local configuration files

### What This Application Does NOT Do
- ❌ Connect to internet
- ❌ Send any data externally
- ❌ Collect user information
- ❌ Install system services
- ❌ Modify system files
- ❌ Require administrator rights (normally)

### Antivirus Considerations
Some antivirus software may flag unknown executables:
- This is common for applications without code-signing certificates
- The application is safe and contains no malware
- You may need to add an exception in your antivirus
- Windows Defender may show SmartScreen warning (click "More info" → "Run anyway")

## Version Information

**Current Version**: 1.0.0 (Initial Release)
**Release Date**: December 2024  
**Architecture**: x64  
**Compiled With**: Python 3.9  
**Build Type**: Standalone executable

## Known Issues & Workarounds

### Force Feedback Compatibility
**Issue**: Force feedback may stop working if application is started after iRacing

**Technical Cause**: Python's pygame library (used for joystick handling) can conflict with iRacing's device access when initialized after the sim has already claimed the devices.

**Solutions**:
1. **Best Practice**: Always start application BEFORE starting iRacing
2. **Alternative**: Enable "Keyboard Only Mode" in settings
   - Completely bypasses joystick handling
   - Eliminates all device conflicts
   - Recommended if only using keyboard for bindings
3. **If Already Occurred**: Restart iRacing (app can stay running)

**Note**: This is not a bug in the application - it's an inherent limitation of how Python handles device access on Windows. Many Python-based sim tools have similar considerations.  

## Update Process

Updates are manual:
1. Download new version from Releases
2. Extract to same location (overwrite)
3. Configurations are preserved automatically
4. No uninstall of old version required

## Troubleshooting Dependencies

### If Application Won't Start

**Error: "VCRUNTIME140.dll not found"**
- Install Visual C++ Redistributable
- Download from Microsoft (free)
- Restart computer

**Error: "Failed to execute script"**
- Ensure Windows 10/11 64-bit
- Check Windows Event Viewer for details
- Try running as Administrator

**Error: "Cannot find iRacing"**
- iRacing must be running
- Must be in an active session
- Check iRacing SDK is working
